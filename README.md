## Contributing

If you'd like to contribute, that's great and I encourage it - I do, however, also encourage reading the [contributing doc](https://github.com/conwaysgame/javascript/blob/master/contributing.md) first. The golden rule for contributing is that **you ensure that the tests are still passing before you make a pull request.**
